## Getting Started

First, run the server:

```bash
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

For other devices within LAN, use host PC IP, ie: http://192.168.1.1:3000. It is recommended to use Chrome browser.

By default, camera access is restricted, follow this steps in this [GUIDE](https://medium.com/@Carmichaelize/enabling-the-microphone-camera-in-chrome-for-local-unsecure-origins-9c90c3149339) to allow access to host IP address.
